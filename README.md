# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1.Assign the value 16 to a variable a. 

2.Use the built-in bin() function to convert the number to binary.

3.Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ 
```python
a=16
print(bin(a))
```
